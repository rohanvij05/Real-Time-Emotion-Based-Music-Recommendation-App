# Real-Time-Emotion-Based-Music-Recommendation-App
The Real-Time Emotion-Based Music Recommendation App detects user emotions through facial recognition using the DeepFace library. It then recommends a playlist of 5 songs based on the detected emotion (happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise). Built with Flask and OpenCV, the app provides a personalized music experience in real-time.
